<h1>This is a Television Project</h1>
<hr>
<p>The project should work as if it was a tv with its remote to change channels and turn the volume up, down, and muted</p>

Trying my best to reduce the CSS using Bootstrap, but maybe will add the CSS later with a more approach to it. We'll see.

I'm pretty satisfied for now, but of course, there's always room for improvement
